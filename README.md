# Finding-the-BEST-Markets-to-Advertise


The goal of this project is to find the two best markets to advertise product in for an e-learning company. Company offers courses on programming. Most of courses are on web and mobile development but they also covers many other domains like data science, game development etc.

The data for this project comes from freeCodeCamp - free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of this analysis. The survey data is publicly available here.
